# Birthday List App

A simple app that displays a list of famous birthdays for the given day, powered by Wikipedia. Strong typing for the wikipedia response body can be found in the types file.

This app features a simple React Context that provides a store around data fetching and related properties.

A test suite has been included that provides a mocked context provider. The suite covers key app behaviors and expectations.

Given more time, I would build more granular components and also expand the app to include more information from the wikipedia response body (selected events, deaths, events, and holidays). I would also look at providing text inputs for arbitrary dates and also provide "yesterday" and "tomorrow" buttons.
